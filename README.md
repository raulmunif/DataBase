This project is a full-stack application that serves as a user information management system. The front-end of the application is built with React and it provides a user-friendly interface for inputting basic user information such as name, ID, email, and phone number.

When a user enters their information, the data is sent to the back-end of the application, which is responsible for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The back-end is built with Node.js and Express.js, and it communicates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve user data.

The MySQL database is set up using XAMPP, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package that allows for easy setup and management of the MySQL database.

The application is designed with a focus on user experience, ensuring that entering and managing user information is as seamless and efficient as possible.
